        <h2>About Page</h2>
        <p>French macarons are sandwich cookies with a crispy exterior. They are made from egg whites, sugar, and almond
            flour. Often called the king of French sweets, this patisserie is the preferred dessert for weddings, bridal
            gatherings, baby showers, and other festive occasions. The macarons are an ever-growing trend in the bakery
            world, with bakers producing varieties with new flavors.</p>

        <h2>Ladurée Paris sells over 4,000,000 macarons per year</h2>
        <p>Ladurée is one of the most popular macaron makers in Paris, and many people rate it as the best macaron
            online shop in the city. In fact, Ladurée is so popular that it has now opened shops not only all around
            Paris but also all over the world. Ladurée’s macarons are offered in the standard size as well as a mini
            version. As per an estimate, the four Laudrée shops in Paris collectively sell 12,000 macarons per day —
            approximately 4.3 million per year.</p>

        <h2>They are gluten-free</h2>
        <p>The ingredients used in a traditional macaron cookie are naturally gluten-free: almond flour, powdered sugar,
            egg whites, granulated sugar. The filling — cream, ganache, or jam, is also gluten-free. However, it is
            important to note that some flavors of macarons may contain gluten, based on the kinds of extra ingredients
            that are added to the cookies or buttercream. If a bakery advertises that they are making gluten-free goods,
            it has been careful to avoid cross-contamination while working with those ingredients.</p>

        <h2>Traditional Macarons are not vegan</h2>
        <p>Traditional Macarons are made up of meringue shells or cookies and buttercream filling. The meringue shells
            are made using egg whites, almond flour, and sugar. So they are not vegan. While there are lots of macrons
            available in the market that do not contain egg white, they may have some type of animal-derived
            ingredients. Bakers also use aquafaba, an eggless alternative to the meringue. Aquafaba is the juice from
            chickspeas and is high in protein content. .</p>
